        <p>
            In all the wonderful and difficult moments, I've lost myself over the years. This is my
            period of
            rediscovery. Of finding who I am. I am stepping out of isolation and obscurity and reaching
            for my
            innate potential. Shame no longer gets to be the loudest voice in my head, and I hope it doesn't get to
            control you either.
        </p>
        <p>I'm a survivor. I see you and I believe in you.</p>

        <p>Everyone has a story, and there is power in speaking your truth. This is a space to speak your truth,
            anonymously, to release it in to the universe and get positive support from others.
        </p>
        <p>Comments and submissions are monitored for privacy and courtesy purposes. This isn't a space to pursue
            political/religious agendas, but a place to be seen and heard. Please do no include specific names of
            people/religions/organizations. </p>
        <p>Speak to your own struggles. Betrayal, addiction, abuse, discrimination, racism. Everyone has a story,
            and every story deserves to be heard.</p>
