        <p>
            I am a survivor, and this is my story.
            I was 16 years old when my best friend's father sexually assaulted me. It would be almost 20 years
            before I would tell anyone what happened. I am subsequently living with the effects of CPTSD and
            trauma
            associated with the event, which has led to isolation. It has hindered me from reaching my full
            potential, because fear is such a powerful motivator.</p>
        <p>
            Keeping up appearances became extremely
            important, but impossible while letting others in. I lost friendships and many opportunities. But I
            am
            ready to stand, to learn the skills I lack, and to reach out and find a community of survivors like
            me.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>I have also spent more than a decade in an abusive relationship. My -->
        <!-- husband's multiple addictions, -->
        <!-- infidelity, and anger led me to double down on my isolation.-->
